## Checking compilation

After each change, and before finishing, you MUST check using

```sh
cargo check
```

and, if the user gave you a command you can execute, check using that command as well.

You SHOULD perform intermediate checks while writing code.

When you finish, you MUST ensure that the code compiles without errors.

When the code does compile, run auto formatting using

```sh
cargo fmt
```
